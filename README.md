# keccak-asm

Simple wrappers for SHA-3 algorithms written in assembly.

Forked from OpenSSL, [Cryptogams](https://github.com/dot-asm/cryptogams), and [RustCrypto's `sha3`](https://github.com/RustCrypto/hashes/tree/master/sha3).

> [!WARNING]
> Code is somewhat [tested](./tests/test.rs) and [benchmarked](https://github.com/DaniPopes/bench-keccak256).

- ❌: Currently not supported.
- 🟨: Compiles, but is only built, not tested in CI. Should still work normally.
- ✅: Fully supported, with full CI coverage for the most popular target triples,
      e.g. `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.
